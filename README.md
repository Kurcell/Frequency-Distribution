# Frequency-Distribution
Frequency distribution consists of counting how many occurrences of each different object exist in a dataset. 
In this project I implemented four strategies to determine frequency distribution:
1. Sequential - The dataset is explored one by one through a linked list.
2. SortedList - The dataset is first converted into a sorted list, allowing the data to be explored in chunks by comparing.
3. Ordered - The dataset is first sorted and then explored, outcome similar to the previous strategy.
4. Map - The dataset is added into a map with the object serving as a key and it's frequency serving as the value.
